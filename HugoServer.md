# From the very beginning!
So my friend xx is helping me build my personal website.
There have been some back and forth. And we now decide to
use the Hugo theme, named avicenna (we were using sada).
The reason we switched is that avicenna theme allows you to
post blogs, which is more suitable for me. What can I say, 
I am naturally chatty. So here we go!

Since we already got Hugo installed on my computer, I started
from this amazing git [avicenna](https://github.com/hadisinaee/avicenna).
Everything was made pretty clear, except for I messed it up a bit
when run the following command line:
```
$ cp Path/To/YourPrile/profile.jpg ./static/profile.jpg
``
My git bash keeps saying it cannot create regular file './static/profile.jpg',
there is no such file or directory. Eventually I figured on my 
PC it has to be changed to './theme/avicenna/static/profile.jpg'.
(later I realized that the author already mentioned copying the profile
picture in the static folder. But, I still feel the cmd code is more
clear so I kept this note here.
)

I chose an awesome sea otter profile picture (and just so you know,
it is copy right free!)
